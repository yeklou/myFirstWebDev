   <p2>all power in heavens and on the earth is given to me, Go and make 
   of all nations my disciples. Teach them to keep <br>
   everything I've taught you. Such is the word of our Lord Jesus <br>
   when he was about to leave his disciples. From these statement of Jesus <br>
   come down two main assignements: the Domination over the powers of <br>
   darkness and the discipleship. These two assignments, in addition to the fact<br> 
   that we believe God has a wonderful plan for every men  he created<br>
   are the vision.....
